# Understanding Startup Errors in Klaviyo MCP Server

## Important Notice for Users

**When you first start Claude Desktop with the Klaviyo MCP tool, you will see several JSON parsing error notifications appear. This is normal and expected behavior.**

These warnings do not indicate a problem with the tool or your setup - they are simply messages from the underlying communication protocol and can be safely dismissed. After Claude Desktop has fully initialized, these warnings will stop appearing, and the tool will function normally.

## Technical Explanation

When Claude Desktop starts, it attempts to connect to all registered MCP tools immediately. During this initialization phase, there can be JSON parsing errors in the communication that trigger error popups in the UI. These errors do not affect functionality but can be alarming for users who don't know what they represent.

### Why These Errors Occur

The MCP protocol uses JSON-RPC over stdio for communication. During the initial connection:

1. Claude Desktop and the MCP server exchange multiple messages to establish the connection
2. Timing issues or partial messages can result in malformed JSON
3. These parsing errors generate warning popups in Claude Desktop
4. Once the connection is properly established, normal communication resumes without errors

### What Users Should Know

1. **The errors are expected and harmless** - They do not indicate any issue with your configuration
2. **They only appear during startup** - Once Claude is running, you should not see additional errors
3. **All functionality works normally** - The MCP tool will function correctly despite these initial warnings
4. **They can be safely dismissed** - You can close the warnings without concern

## Our Error Handling Solution

We've implemented robust error handling that addresses JSON parsing issues during normal operation. While startup errors still appear due to how Claude Desktop initializes MCP tools, all runtime operations will function correctly.

If you have any concerns or questions about these warnings, please contact support.
